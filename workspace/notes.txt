terraform workspace list #We need to do init first

Subcommands:
    delete    Delete a workspace
    list      List Workspaces
    new       Create a new workspace
    select    Select a workspace
    show      Show the name of the current workspace

terraform workspace new dev (Creates dev workspace)
terraform workspace select dev (Switch to this)

If we are using workspace then we should be very careful about variables

If need safety then Create:  seperate repo for dev, seperate repo for production

workspace, tfvars  --> Suitable for Small projects
-------------------
adv --> less code, Can Switch easily between workspace
dis --> should be more careful while dealing variables and tfvars. chance of doing something wrong in prod

seperate repos --> For large / big organisations this suits
------------------
adv --> clear seperation of environments
dis --> duplication of code

provisioners
-------------------
Using terraform we are creating instances....

1. local-exec --> where you are running terraform command i.e local
2. remote-exec --> inside remote machine
